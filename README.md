## List of currently-supported schools:
- Harvey Mudd College

## How was this developed?

- Frontend of HyperPlanner made using TypeScript and React

- Netlify used for deployment of the web app

- Travis CI used for CI/CD tests

- Jest/React Testing Library used for unit tests

- Code Coverage and Code Climate used to assess the maintainability of the code and the coverage of tests

- Docker used to create a consistent development environment

- Makefile used to make the development commands easy to remember and use

- Prettier and ESLint (Airbnb preferences) used for best coding practices

- Auth0 used for user authentication

- Google Analytics used to track site statistics

## Where is the Backend?

The Backend of HyperPlanner uses Hasura, which is an open source engine connecting our PostgreSQL Database to our GraphQL Backend. This is hosted on Heroku, located [here](https://hyperplanner.herokuapp.com/console). The Frontend communicates with the GraphQL engine using Apollo Client.

## What is the development workflow?

First clone the repository onto your local machine. Note that on Windows, if using Git Bash, you will need to install Make. Look [here](https://gist.github.com/evanwill/0207876c3243bbb6863e65ec5dc3f058) for more information on installing Make. You will also need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) downloaded.
You can then run the following commands:

#### `make build`

Creates the Docker development container.<br />

#### `make serve`

Runs the app in the development mode with live updates.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

#### `make format`

Formats the files with Prettier.<br />

#### `make lint`

Lints the files with ESLint.<br />
